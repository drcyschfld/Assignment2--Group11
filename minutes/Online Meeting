Online Meeting;
Monday, 15th April
Attendees: Kyan Gan, Tom Henry, Darcy Schofield

Recap on previous items:
exercise 1, 2 and 3 complete except for commenting. Integration task begun and mostly finished.


-Discussion on how to present project during the lab assessment -> integration task; does it need to include advanced 
functionality of exercise 1 and aspects of the basic functionality of exercise 2?
-exercise 2 needed a delay loop in it to slow down the rate at which the lights flash wehn receiving a string. 
for(int i = 1; i = 8,000,000; i++) -> should delay the lights flash by a second or so (8MHz)
-Planned to meet at 12pm, tuesday the 16th, 2 hours before the presentation to do a practice presentation and make sure the
group is prepared and ready to present the project
-Decided that each member needs to complete the readme for the respective exercise. Additionally, the github needs to be tidied.


Action Tasks: the readme file needs to be filled out before the presentation of the project tomorrow; this includes group member 
contribution, the code functionality, user instructions and testing procedures. Also, everyone needs to git push the final copy of 
their exercise and the integration task (exercise 4) to the main branch so that its clean/tidy and ready for presentation.
